# STATE.md — Based Cup living state log

Read **CLAUDE.md** first (laws/build/deploy). Deep internals are in **PROJECT_BRIEF.md**. This file = current state only.

> ## ⚠️ END-OF-SESSION RULE — update BEFORE you wrap (this is what stops cross-session drift)
> At every clean stopping point and always before ending a session, update this file:
> 1. **Current build number** (the `## Current build:` line below) — match the badge you bumped in `game_template.html`.
> 2. **Status table** — flip rows to their real status (done / in-flight / next) + build #.
> 3. **Log** — add a one-line `bNN:` entry for what changed + what's next.
>
> Then confirm the badge is bumped and `index.html` is built/validated. (Rules/gotchas change → update CLAUDE.md instead.)

## Current build: **b53** (badge in `game_template.html`, search `based-cup bNN ✓`)
Last verified: line-1094 TypeError fixed + reproduced-then-gone in-browser; `drawPlayer` renders all chars in-match (pixel-proven); 0 errors, 0 leftover tokens, 0 placeholder sprites, harness passes.
✅ **b53 = real fix** for the live `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLowerCase')` @1094 throw. The keydown/keyup input handlers called `e.key.toLowerCase()`/`e.code.toLowerCase()` with no guard; **synthetic key events from browser autofill / extensions (Phantom wallet, password managers) fire with `key`/`code` undefined** → threw mid-match. Fixed with a `typeof e.key!=='string'` guard (b46/b52 were sprite-file/cache red herrings — the actual bug was code, in the input path, NOT drawPlayer).
This folder is the git checkout (branch `main` tracking `origin/main`); deploy = `git push origin main`.

## Roster (14 characters)
`grabCap()` identical for ALL (no hitbox advantage). `key` = internal id / sprite filename. Stats balanced ~21.

Art source library: `OneDrive\Desktop\SOCC\CHARACTERS` (and the `C` subfolder = the b43 refresh batch). More chars exist there to add if asked.
*(How to add a character — the sprite pipeline — is in PROJECT_BRIEF §7 + the memory note.)*

---

## Roadmap / next candidates (detail in PROJECT_BRIEF §11)
- **TURN server** — lets P2P connect through strict/mobile (CGNAT) NATs (currently STUN-only → those fall back to relay). Biggest remaining latency win.
- **4-player (2v2)** — requested, not built. Needs rooms-of-4 in `server.js` (+fly redeploy), 2v2 teams + 4-player render/collision, binary/delta snapshot encoding (~6× bandwidth), star-topology P2P. Multi-phase — defer, don't half-build.
- More characters available in `SOCC\CHARACTERS` on request.

## Watch-outs (live)
- OneDrive actively churns/dehydrates files in this folder (sprites, build.py have gone missing mid-session). Verify before building; `_cut` sprite backups are in the session scratchpad.

## Log
- b53: **fixed the live `toLowerCase` of undefined @1094 TypeError (real CODE bug).** Mapped built `index.html`:1094 → template:1094 (1:1, both 3571 lines): the global `keyup` handler `keys[e.key.toLowerCase()]=false; keys[e.code.toLowerCase()]=false;` (and keydown @1091/1092). Root cause: real `KeyboardEvent`s always carry `key`/`code`, but **synthetic key events from browser autofill + extensions (Phantom wallet, password managers) arrive as generic events with `key`/`code` undefined** → `.toLowerCase()` threw, firing 2× (keydown+keyup) and at arbitrary times incl. mid-match. REPRODUCED in-browser (`dispatchEvent(new Event('keyup'))` → exact `@line:1094` throw), then confirmed GONE after the fix (synthetic events now fire 0 errors; real KeyboardEvents still work). Fix: guard `if(typeof e.key!=='string') return;` on both handlers + guard `e.code` independently (missing values are legitimately possible, so defensive guard is correct). Separately pixel-proved `drawPlayer` renders all chars in-match (pepe/chad/soyjak/wojak each draw 2.8k–4.1k head pixels) — the "blank in-match" was the earlier b46 cache, not a render bug. Harness passed while this shipped (it doesn't dispatch synthetic key events) — that's why prior sprite-file/cache audits missed it.
- b52: **"sprites disappeared" bug report — root-caused as NOT a build defect.** Diagnosed the 3 known causes in order: (1) all 14 `_cut`/`_cut_s.png` present + non-zero on disk (no OneDrive churn), (2) deployed `index.html` had 0 leftover tokens AND 0 `TINY` placeholders, all 14 `*_SRC` constants filled with real base64 PNGs, (3) `THRESH3=110` (correct). Runtime check in a real browser: all 14 `IMG` objects load at 360×450, `blankOrFailed:[]`, title scene renders a sprite. Conclusion: the b51 artifact renders all sprites — the live symptom is environmental (stale cache / b51 deploy not propagated; live was b46 before the recent push). Action: bumped badge → b52, clean rebuild + full ship gate, pushed to force a fresh Vercel deploy so the live build is confirmable. ⚠️ If the live badge still shows b46/blank after hard-refresh, the issue is the Vercel project's production-branch wiring, not the code. No code/sprite change was needed.
- b51 (deploy): **git wiring + first git-push deploy.** Made the working folder a real git checkout on `main` tracking `origin/main`; merged the deployed repo assets (`api/`, `package.json`, `supabase-schema.sql`, `README.md`) with the full local source via an unrelated-histories merge (only overlap was `index.html` — kept the validated b51, origin's old b46 stays in history). Pushed → `origin/main` `141b444`; Vercel auto-deploys from `main`. Deploy is now `git push` (was: manual upload) — CLAUDE.md updated. NOTE: the ~25 MB binary push takes >2 min — push in the background, don't kill on a foreground timeout. Next: TURN server or 2v2 when the user picks.
- b51 (docs): **docs consolidation** — three live docs (CLAUDE = laws, STATE = state, PROJECT_BRIEF = deep reference); archived the stale b24 deep briefing to `archive/HANDOFF.b24-snapshot.md` (its still-current infra/gotchas migrated into PROJECT_BRIEF §12–13); CLAUDE trimmed to 1 page of laws/guards/commands; STATE got this pinned end-of-session rule + status board. No game code changed (badge bump only).
- b50: crash-proof guard on `EXTRA_CHARS` (un-built file can't dead-screen) + root-caused the "won't start" bug = user was deploying `game_template.html` not `index.html`.
- b49/b48: on-screen error reporter (+ copy button).
- b47: head-soccer drawPlayer (no ring, face-centred, team pool).
- b46: face-normalised sprites (chin-aligned, consistent size) + per-char ADJUST.
- b45: invisible-face fix (THRESH3 110), neck/crop rework, ball rubber-band fix, intro tap-to-skip.
- b44: intro reveal. b43: 13-char art refresh. b41/b42: mobile layout + overlay scroll.
- b40: 60/55Hz tick + lower interp floors. b39: 7 more chars + WebRTC P2P. b38: warmed server-ping. b37: mobile control/aim fixes.
